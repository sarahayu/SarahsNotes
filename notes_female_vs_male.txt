despite the emergence of the metrosexual and an increase in stay at home dads, tough guy stereotypes die hard. as men continue to fall behind women in college, while outpacing them four to one in the suicide rate, some colleges are waking up to the fact that men may need to be taught to think beyond their own stereotypes. in many ways, the young men who take my seminar mirror national trends; based on their grades and writing assignments, it’s clear that they spend less time on homework than female students do, and while every bit as intelligent, they earn lower grades with studied indifference. when i asked one of my male students why he didnt openly fret about grades the way so many women do, he said, nothings worse for a guy than looking like a try hard
